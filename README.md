Issues
Another challenge out of the way. They don't call them challenges for nothing. This was another assingment that had me developing all aspects of my thinking power. As I progress through the course and work on each assingment I do feel my capabilities and knowledge expanding. 

I am pleased to have completed the task a hand, I look forward to more of them and to growing and learning in thi coding journey.
